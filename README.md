# BM3D_GPU
The BM3D image denoising algorithm implemented in CUDA.

The dependencies are:

1) CUDA 7.5 (or newer)

2) Boost library

3) FreeImagePlus library (to read raw format input images)

4) OpenMP

5) chrono library for timing 



after compiling, running command is:

./binary "image file name"  "format" "input directory" "out directory"



The input images can be png files or raw input images from various cameras such as .cr2 , .arw, .nef , .rw2, .sr2 (any input format that FreeImagePlus can read).
The implementation uses tiling for high resolution images to fit the GPU memory and shared memory.
